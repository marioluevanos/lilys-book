Right before her Hello Kitty themed party, Lily is feeling anxious, happy, excited, sleepy, tired that she is having a birthday party, and all of her friends will be there, including her best friend, Ruth. Ruth has light brown skin, black straight hair, round nose, and likes to wear blue dresses. When Ruth visits Lily's party, they and the rest of the kids at the party enjoy  a big pink bouncy castle with a water slide. They break a piñata out in the driveway, while Lily's Dad holds the piñata rope from the roof, and his niece is holding the other end, standing on a ladder. Days later, they both go the Chuck E. Cheese and enjoy playing games and jumping on the trampoline. Mom is exhausted by then. Just adventures of Lily and her best friend Ruth.
